1.a)Copy a file to another file using BR, BW. Test it. 
b) Then take source and destination as input from user by asking question.
If the input file does not exist, show a proper error message to the user.
If the destination file exists,append to the end of the file.

2.Search for a string occurrence in a file. String, path is taken as input.
Print the path of the file, its size, full name, creation date to the monitor as well.

3.Take input from user a list of names. Provide option to search for a given string in the list. Retain only unique names. The user should be able to list the names as well [along with sorting]. The menu given to the user should appear as shown below:

Enter number to select Menu option:
 1.Add name
 2.List names
 3.Search
 4.Store
 5.Load
 6.Exit

On entering option 1, you can ask the user to input the name. On entering option 3, you can ask the user to enter search string.
Store the names given 

4. Print the number of occurrences of each word in a file to the console.
5. Build a menu program to take the name and phonenum as input from the user.
He should be able to add/edit/list/delete the same. The data should be saved to a file with format name=phoneNum per line.

Ex code:
		BufferedReader br = null; BufferedWriter bw = null;
		int n;
		String line;
		try
		{
			// initialize res var
			br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fromPath));
			bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(toPath));
			
			// apply business logic
			while((line = br.readLine())!=null)
			{
				System.out.println(line);
				bw.write(line);
				bw.newLine();
				//bw.flush();
						
			}
			
		}
		catch(IOException e)
		{
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		catch(Exception e)
		{
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
		finally
		{
			try
			{
				if(br!=null)
					br.close();
				if(bw!=null)
					bw.close();
			}
			catch(IOException e)
			{
				e.printStackTrace();
			}
		}
		
Another ex:
		File f1 = new File("/Users/vikramshastry/Desktop/");
		System.out.println("does f1 exist ? "+f1.exists());
		System.out.println("is file ? "+f1.isFile());
		System.out.println("is dir ? "+f1.isDirectory());
		System.out.println("length ? "+f1.length());
		System.out.println("full path "+f1.getAbsolutePath());
